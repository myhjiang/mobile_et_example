0	1.09	2.29	 so I'm confused right now.
1	2.29	4.25	 What this means.
2	6.31	9.08	 What I want to tell you this way has he won't be alive.
3	9.64	10.33	 More Pio eyes.
4	10.33	31.35	 Okay , so I'm trying to navigate to the first point , and I'm actually kind of finding the virtual reality distracting.
5	32.19	35.95	 Um augmented.
6	35.95	36.28	 Yeah.
7	37.24	47.76	 Just because Aiken it's clear that there's things off into the distance that are in front of me , but that I can't I can't actually see.
8	47.76	58.92	 And so it's hard for me to determine which , which is which , as I'm looking forward , which is maybe only five leave.
9	60.44	62.68	 Yeah , I'm gonna do that.
10	66.04	66.45	 Okay.
11	68.28	73.66	 And so it looks okay.
12	78.32	79.19	 That's interesting.
13	81.45	86.44	 There's a highlighting when I selected it.
14	86.44	89.85	 Highlights that doesn't highlight on the map.
15	90.94	95.77	 So I can't be certain which one I've actually selected here.
16	99.04	111.05	 Okay , so I'm going to stop using the augmented reality because I'm a little confused by it , and I'm gonna try to navigate by the map instead.
17	124.96	131.47	 So I know I'm just trying to go to Menzis , and I'm gonna pull up the information I'm in front of it.
18	133.43	136.75	 This was a place where I knew where it was already , but I don't know what it is.
19	137.53	140.81	 so I'll be interested to find out what this What?
20	140.81	155.78	 This building actually is okay Right now , I'm just reading this aloud here.
21	156.72	159.4	 Menzis is one of the largest Dutch insurance companies in Netherlands.
22	159.4	161.07	 It's located next to see building.
23	161.54	164.1	 Pressel tried Enschede building.
24	164.1	169.48	 It was the former roar a track through Enschede , a North Station villa Enschede , our station and then removed.
25	169.48	170.36	 Menzis was built.
26	179.14	185.35	 Okay , so this used to be the location of a train station , which I do not know.
27	188.74	189.99	 We're gonna take a note of that.
28	197.32	208.5	 Hey , I'm gonna call it Menzis one.
29	223.22	226.87	 I'm just saying that he's around the sites of a former train station.
30	231.45	233.26	 I am not spelling this.
31	233.26	238.96	 Well , I'm used to a Google android keypad.
32	239.94	249.55	 Okay , How do I I'm not sure how to submit Note.
33	257.09	258.25	 I just hit back.
34	259.81	261.98	 Okay , So hitting back is how you submit the note.
35	261.99	264.26	 That was not clear to me.
36	266.9	274.89	 Okay , so now I'm back and I want to look at the men Menzis the rest of information , but I can't see.
37	276.74	280.53	 I can't find the p o I.
38	281.84	282.35	 Here we go.
39	283.11	283.82	 It's behind me.
40	288.9	290.46	 Something very strange is happening.
41	290.46	292.48	 Where keeps sliding off screen.
42	294.13	296.08	 So I'm gonna try to click on the map instead.
43	296.09	296.46	 Okay?
44	302.0	304.27	 So I'm looking at the old railway station.
45	309.04	309.75	 Interesting.
46	317.44	321.12	 Okay , I'm gonna proceed to one more location.
47	321.12	338.32	 The Beatrix Bridge tunnel , I should say and looks as though the position of the immersive is not in the right location.
48	340.7	345.71	 And I wonder if the wind is having an impact here because it's falling.
49	345.72	346.95	 Okay , so there's Menzis.
50	352.44	358.68	 It's being chased off the screen as I turned , and so it should be in front of me.
51	360.03	367.25	 But the actual icon is being pushed off , making me think I should go this way when I know I should be going this way.
52	368.53	373.65	 We're gonna go back to the map now and there stairs here so I don't wanna fall.
53	375.64	377.61	 You're recording my verbalization Sze , right?
54	377.97	378.2	 Yeah.
55	379.64	380.05	 Okay.
56	382.94	383.28	 Okay.
57	383.28	397.14	 So I've also been in this tunnel , and I find it's a much better way to get to the train station from ITC than to go around because I hate stopping at that stoplight.
58	398.21	399.15	 That one takes forever.
59	402.24	416.11	 Okay , so it looks like the tunnel is attached over here , so I'm gonna pull this up because I'm not quite certain where it wants me.
60	416.11	416.59	 to go.
61	423.51	424.58	 I'm reading this aloud.
62	424.59	426.61	 Tunnel name is one of the Dutch princesses.
63	427.34	429.55	 It's a little current station.
64	433.44	441.56	 So my understanding is that this tunnel pre existed the collapse of the of the textile industry.
65	442.23	447.57	 So this was here even though the train station was on the other side , which is interesting.
66	448.93	455.86	 Okay , we're gonna make a note of that.
67	484.44	486.65	 Have you notes Just to make sure.
68	487.54	487.95	 Okay.
69	488.41	491.05	 No , I'm gonna start ordering my notes just for my own sick.
70	491.6	492.95	 So I've taken to so far.
71	494.84	500.09	 All right , so I'm gonna head back to the , ah , the area with the textile industry.
72	501.38	510.05	 This is an area and less familiar with , and I'm primarily just using the map right now , although I know where I'm going.
73	510.06	513.16	 So I should just I should probably Yeah.
74	513.17	520.35	 So the ITC So I'm just gonna return to the ITC building without paying too much attention to the map.
75	525.2	528.65	 So I would have guessed Menzis was like an ice cream.
76	530.24	535.47	 Yeah , I had no idea was insurance , so I'm learning something.
77	536.19	537.65	 At first I thought it was a restaurant.
78	538.6	549.13	 So when I first got here , Yeah , I'm seeing people give me strange looks for wearing these glasses.
79	554.71	573.65	 They probably think they're being recorded on Google Glass , but okay , so I didn't actually click on the ITC building.
80	574.68	578.3	 I didn't realize I had been there and been there already.
81	579.44	587.55	 So one thing that would be really neat is if the app signaled which locations you've already been to.
82	588.24	601.51	 Both that you've already clicked information , but also were sort of geo fence was in a particular area so that you know that you've actually physically been there because that would help me determine which points I haven't been to yet.
83	602.77	604.6	 I didn't realize that there was a point here.
84	606.04	606.65	 Okay.
85	606.66	611.98	 ITC building , faculty of Geo Information Science and Earth Observation University.
86	611.99	619.11	 Twente 19 nineties Enschede North Station.
87	623.24	626.95	 Okay , I've taken this picture of myself.
88	628.73	630.25	 This looks like the same map.
89	630.74	632.75	 So this also was the former train station.
90	636.04	642.18	 Okay , this looks like it's doing a little better.
91	642.64	646.54	 I wonder if I think actually this protection is causing it.
92	653.14	655.85	 Yeah , it's definitely impacting the barometer in some way.
93	656.74	659.05	 Um , the compass.
94	659.82	661.89	 Okay , so I knew that about the ITC.
